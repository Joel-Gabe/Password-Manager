Password Manager Project   
Created by Gabe Foster and Joel Robinson

# About
During our Python class, our professor identified us strong students who needed more challenge. His solution was to assign us to build a project instead of taking the final exam. Over a month we were able to build a fully functioning password manager. The password manager uses RSA encryption to keep the data secure with asymmetric encryption, the PyQt5 libraries to handle the GUI for ease of use, and the SQLite database engine to manage the data. To complete this project we learned how to package our application for both MacOS and Windows as well, you can find the download links below. Neither of us had prior experience with the technologies used.
